Please review the projects workflow in its entirety. I would like you to become a SME on this section. Once you have fully reviewed all code pertaining to the project workflow, I would like you to diagnose why a freelancer gets an error when pressing the Workspace button to view further details of the project they have won. Console logs for error attached. Only do this once you believe that you have all available and necessary information pertaining to projects. Do not revise, change or add any code at this point. You are to diagnose, propose the most suitable solution, consider any issues that could arise from your solution, ensure your solution does not negatively impact any other functionality or code of the website, allow me to review the solution and I will let you know how to proceed. 

Please proceed. Ensure we are only modifying code that strictly pertains to the task at hand. Once completed, please committ and push to git, so it can go through Vercel and Railway and I can test once redeployments complete.
