**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Status**: Ready for Testing

---

## Overview

The admin panel is now fully implemented and ready for testing. This guide will help you set up an admin user and test all features.

---

## Quick Access

- **Admin Panel URL**: http://localhost:3000/admin
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:5003/api/admin/*

---

## Step 1: Create Admin User

You need to manually set a user's role to ADMIN in the database.

### Option A: Using Prisma Studio (Recommended)

1. Open Prisma Studio:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npx prisma studio
   ```

2. Navigate to the `User` model
3. Find your test user (e.g., `john.client@example.com`)
4. Edit the user and change `role` from `CLIENT` to `ADMIN`
5. Save changes

### Option B: Using SQL

Connect to your PostgreSQL database and run:

```sql
UPDATE users
SET role = 'ADMIN'
WHERE email = 'john.client@example.com';
```

### Option C: Create New Admin User

```sql
INSERT INTO users (
  id, email, username, "firstName", "lastName",
  password, role, "isVerified", "createdAt", "updatedAt", "lastActiveAt"
) VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  'admin@rowflow.com',
  'admin',
  'Admin',
  'User',
  '$2b$10$YourHashedPasswordHere', -- Use the same hash as other test users
  'ADMIN',
  true,
  NOW(),
  NOW(),
  NOW()
);
```

## Step 2: Log In to Admin Panel

1. Start your servers (if not already running):
   ```bash
   # From project root
   start-dev.bat
   ```

2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000

3. Log in with your admin credentials:
   - Email: The email you set to ADMIN role
   - Password: `password123` (default test password)

4. After login, navigate to: http://localhost:3000/admin

## Step 4: Verify Existing Functionality

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure nothing broke!

### Test Normal User Flows
- [ ] Client can still log in
- [ ] Freelancer can still log in
- [ ] Non-admin users CANNOT access /admin (should redirect)
- [ ] Projects still work normally
- [ ] Services still work normally
- [ ] Payments still work normally
- [ ] Messages still work

### Test API Endpoints
- [ ] `/api/projects` still works
- [ ] `/api/services` still works
- [ ] `/api/payments` still works
- [ ] All non-admin endpoints unaffected

---

## Step 5: Test Security

### Authentication Tests
- [ ] Log out and try to access /admin - should redirect to login
- [ ] Log in as CLIENT and try to access /admin - should redirect to home
- [ ] Log in as FREELANCER and try to access /admin - should redirect to home
- [ ] Only ADMIN role can access admin panel

### API Security Tests
Try these API calls WITHOUT admin token:
```bash
# Should return 403 Forbidden
curl http://localhost:5003/api/admin/dashboard/stats

# Should return 403 Forbidden
curl http://localhost:5003/api/admin/transactions
```

Try these API calls WITH admin token:
```bash
# Should return data
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" http://localhost:5003/api/admin/dashboard/stats
```

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Admin access required" Error

### Issue: Actions not working (release/refund)
**Solution**:
1. Check backend logs for errors
2. Verify Stripe credentials are set
3. Check that escrow/order is in correct status
